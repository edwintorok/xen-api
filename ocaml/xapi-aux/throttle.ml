  (** [perform_delay delay] calls {!val:Thread.delay} when [delay] is non-zero.

    To avoid issues with floating-point rounding, we consider everything smaller than {!val:Float.epsilon} equivalent to 0.
    Thread.delay 0 provides no fairness guarantees, the current thread may actually be the one that gets the global lock again.
    Instead {!val:Thread.yield} could be used, which does provide fairness guarantees, but it may also introduce large latencies
    when there are lots of threads waiting for the OCaml runtime lock.
