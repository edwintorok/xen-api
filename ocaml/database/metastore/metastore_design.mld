{0 XAPI metadata storage design}

{1 Documentation syntax}

This file is a .mld file which contains [odoc] documentation syntax
(everything that would be acceptable in a documentation comment [(** *)]).

For convenience the syntax documentation can be found here:
https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/odoc_for_authors.html
https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/ocamldoc_differences.html#reference-syntax

The documentation can be built during development with:
{v
$ dune build @doc-private
v}

Output can be found in [_build/default/_doc/_html].
Once a package is installed with 'opam' then documentation can be built with:
{v
$ odig doc xapi
v}

{1 Build and module organization}

{2 Opam package}

We have several opam packages in the XAPI monorepo, however the following
guidelines can be used to determine which library should go where:

{ul
{- executables installed in Dom0 need to be part of a package
  - multiple executables {b can} be part of the same package
}
{- libraries used outside of the monorepo (e.g. XAPI client) need to have a package
  - although a single package {b can} contain multiple libraries if subpackages
    are used in public_name with '.'
}
{- all dependencies of public libraries must themselves be public libraries}
{- libraries used only by executables (or shared by executables only) should be
  private libraries
}
}

The metadata store is {b only} used by XAPI (anything else that needs the
metadata store should talk to the metadata store using its native protocol and
just query XAPI for the local URL), so therefore it should be part of the XAPI
package.

Note that the current layout of opam packages and public libraries is not ideal
(we have too many of them). Ideally it should be simplified to have only the
following as public:

- separate processes may want to have a separate package if they already do
(e.g. xenopsd)
- clients for XAPI's external and internal API have to be public libraries
- libraries shared between several public libraries need to be themselves
  public, but preferably they can be added as a sub-package into an existing library.
- clients for other services, e.g. [forkexecd]

{2 Dune library}

The metadata store should be a library, and we may eventually want to make
XAPI's database use it.
To avoid circular dependencies and startup ordering problems this library
should be linkable from the [xapi_database] library, which is an internal
library. Therefore this should be an internal library too.

To detect cyclic dependencies early on add a dependency from [xapi_database]
to [xapi_metastore]

{2 External dependencies}

Where possible we should use external libraries for common types that are
widely known in the ecosystem.
We currently use strings in too many places, however a more granular type for
specific strings can make the code less error-prone and the API easier to
understand and use. In particular the following libraries are desirable:

- fmt: {!module:Fmt} for declaring pretty printers and debugging dump printers
- fpath: {!module:Fpath} for file system paths
- ipaddr: {!module:Ipaddr}
- logs: {!module:Logs} provides lower overhead logging, and is already
  integrated with [xapi-logs]
- rresult: {!module:Rresult} for the [('a, [> `Msg of string]) result]
  convention and combinators (although {!module:Result} is now part of the stdlib)
- uri: {!module:Uri}
- uuidm: {!module:Uuidm}

{2 Serialization}

There are many ways to serialize OCaml records (including by hand), XAPI
extensively uses [rpclib] and its [ppx] deriver, so this library will use that too.

(Other possibilities: [sexplib] which is used by xapi too, or [ppx_fields_conv])

{2 Generated documentation}

Documentation needs to be part of a package, according to the above that will
be the [xapi] package.
For now we don't want to take over XAPI's index, so we'll link to the
appropriate sections of this design from individual modules' documentation.

{2 Licensing}

The metastore will be a core part of XAPI, providing a core piece of
functionality, and should thus be under the same license as XAPI itself.

{1 Types}

{2 Unique identifiers}

The database module uses strings, XAPI uses {!module:Ref}.
However we don't necessarily want to introduce a dependency on [xapi-types],
since that one is quite slow to build due to having to regenerate whenever the
IDL/API changes.
And putting the metastore in [xapi-types] isn't right either, because that is
used by the XAPI client (in fact that library should be changed to be a
subpackage of the xapi client).

Use {!module:Uuidm} for unique identifiers, that is the correct type to use
anyway (eventually we may change the DB to support them natively, for now XAPI
will convert to and from string as needed).

{1 Testing}

{2 Structured fuzzing}

Mathematical properties can be tested with quickcheck-style fuzzing.
This is available in OCaml through a variety of libraries:

- [crowbar]
- [monolith]
- [qcstm]
- [qcheck-stm] intended as a replacement of [qcstm] and can run parallel tests now
- [qcheck-lin] for checking linearizability

For pros/cons of each see this post on the OCaml forum:
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/ann-qcheck-lin-and-qcheck-stm-0-1-0/10933/2?u=edwin

XAPI currently has {!module:Crowbar} available in [xs-opam], therefore that is
used for now.
However oxenstored also had a [monolith] based test-suite, and
[qcheck-stm]/[qcheck-lin] looks promising too.

Examples of properties that should be checked this way:

- argument of {!Map.Make} satisfying {!Map.OrderedType} total order
  requirement. The {!Ref} module had a bug, which prompted adding this test for
  the {!Id} module too.

{2 Rpclib auto-generated tests}

[rpclib] supports auto-generating testcases to check upgradability from older
versions of the data structure (generated test data is committed into
repository, and as the data structure evolves that old data should still be
deserializable)

{1 API reference}

{!modules: Xapi_metastore.Id}
