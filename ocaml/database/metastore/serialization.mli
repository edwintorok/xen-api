val dump : 'a Rpc.Types.typ -> 'a Fmt.t
(** [dump typ_of formatter v] pretty prints [v] by converting it to an {!Rpc.t}
  described by [typ_of] and then formatting that representation.

  This doesn't use {!Rpc.to_string} which would clutter the output with type
  information.

val lowercase : 'a Rpc.Types.typ -> 'a Rpc.Types.typ
(** [lowercase typ] is [typ] serialization with strings converted to lowercase
    when serializing, and capitalized when deserializing *)

     aname:string
  -> ('a -> 'b)
  -> ('b -> 'a)
  -> ?test_data:'a list

(** [using ~aname conv_to conv_from ?test_data typ_of] is an {!Rpc} serializer
    implemented by first converting the OCaml type using [conv_to]
    and then using the [typ_of] serializer of that type.
    Deserialization is implemented using [typ_of] and [conv_from].
    Tests are generated from [test_data] if supplied, otherwise random ['b]
    values are generated and [conv_from] is used to generate test inputs,
    however this will only work if [conv_from] accepts any value for ['b] as
    valid.

    This can be a convenient way for writing a serializer for types like
    Maps or Sets where we cannot modify the original type.
